# Spotify Integration

## How do I play songs/albums/playlists from Spotify?

### Step 1

Open your playlist in Spotify and hit "more" (three dots).

In the pop-up menu, find "share".

### Step 2

Select "Copy Playlist Link".

The link to your playlist will be placed in your clipboard.

Your link should look something like this:
https://open.spotify.com/user/l0nephoenix/playlist/5W5ljT8R174nrkxZ2SalWw?si=IkKnvGZsR9Swppk2-u7Leg

### Step 3

Now go into Discord and paste the link like this:

`-play [the link]`

for example:

`-play https://open.spotify.com/user/l0nephoenix/playlist/5W5ljT8R174nrkxZ2SalWw?si=IkKnvGZsR9Swppk2-u7Leg`


Marv will now play your Spotify playlist in your voice channel!

## How does the Spotify integration work?

Marv fetches the metadata óf the track (title, artist, ...) and searches for an equivalent song on YouTube.

Meaning, if you get the `An equivalent video on YouTube was unable to be found!`-error, you now know why.
