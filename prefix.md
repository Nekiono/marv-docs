> What is a prefix?

The prefix is the character before your commands. By default, it's `-`. By changing it, you will have to put the new bit before all your commands instead of `-`. For example, if you run `-prefix set !`, you now have to run all commands with `!` instead of `-`.

# Server Prefix

The prefix you set here only applies to the current server.

* `-prefix set [new prefix]` Sets a new prefix
* `-prefix` Gets the current custom prefix
* `-prefix reset` Clears the custom prefix and reverts back to the normal one

# User Prefix

The prefix you set here only applies to you. It will be the same, regardless of which server you are on.

* `-user prefix set [new prefix]` Sets a new prefix
* `-user prefix` Gets the current custom prefix
* `-user prefix reset` Clears the custom prefix and reverts back to the normal one
