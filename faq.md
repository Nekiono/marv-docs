### 0. How do I add Marv to my server?
1. [Click this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=234395307759108106&permissions=3263552)
2. Select your server in the drop down menu
3. Press authorize

### 1. Help! Marv drank a red bull and is playing music really fast!
Don't worry! All you have to do is type `-fix it` and Marv will play music at normal speed again.

### 2. Umm, Marv just randomly stopped playing music just for me.
Try disconnecting from your voice channel and reconnecting. Discord currently has a bug where you will stop receiving audio for the bot if it leaves a voice channel in a different server. 

### 3. Marv keeps pausing and playing/stuttering.
First, try changing your server region. If that does not fix it, please contact someone in the support channel.

### 4. How do I stop certain people from using Marv?
Marv has a **blacklist** feature for this exact purpose. All you have to do is type `-blacklist @user` and they will be unable to use Marv in your server. You may also blacklist an entire role by typing `-blacklist @role`, if that's how you roll.

### 5. Wait, what if I want only certain people to be able to use Marv?
Well, that's what we've got a whitelist for! To only let a certain person use Marv, type `-whitelist @user`. To whitelist a role, type `-whitelist @role`.

### 6. Wha?? My bot isn't responding to any of my commands! 
Try using `@Marv` instead of `-`. If it responds, the admins of your server have set a custom prefix. 

### 7. Am I able to make Marv stay in a voice channel forever?
No. Sending audio that nobody will listen to is a waste of Marv's resources.
