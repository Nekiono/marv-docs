### 1. What sites does Marv support?
- Youtube

- Twitch
- Niconico

### 2. How the heck do I play Spotify things?
Type `-spotify` and Marv will give you a little window explaining it or head over to the [spotify section](./spotify).

### 3. Marv is lagging!
Try changing your server region! If that does not fix it, please contact someone in Marv Support.

### 4. How do I stop certain people from using Marv?
Marv has a **blacklist** feature for this exact purpose. All you have to do is type `-blacklist @user` and they will be unable to use Marv in your server. You may also blacklist an entire role by typing `-blacklist @role`, if that's how you roll.

### 5. Wait, what if I want only certain people to be able to use Marv?
Well, that's what we've got a whitelist for! To only let a certain person use Marv, type `-whitelist @user`. To whitelist a role, type `-whitelist @role`.

### 6. Wha?? Marv isn't responding to any of my commands!
Try using `@Marv` instead of `-`. If it responds, the admins of your server have set a custom prefix.

### 7. I purchased premium, but it doesn't seem to work!?
To use premium commands, you need to join the [marv.land Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WmDyx7C) to have the premium-role assigned to you by the Patreon integration.
If you joined it, got your role and still have issues, have a look at [this page](./why-premium-only-works-sometimes)
