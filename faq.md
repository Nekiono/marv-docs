# FAQ

### 0) How do I add Marv to my server?
First off, type `-invite` in a server where Marv can see and click the link it gives you. In the drop down menu, select your server and then press authorize.

### 1) Help! Marv drank a red bull and is playing music really quickly!
Don't worry! All you have to do is type `-fix it` and Marv will play music at normal speed again.

### 2) Marv keeps pausing and playing/stuttering.
First, try changing your server region. If that does not fix it, please contact someone in the support channel.

### 3) How do I stop certain people from using Marv?
Marv has a **blacklist** feature for this exact purpose. All you have to do is type `-blacklist @user` and they will be unable to use Marv in your server. You may also blacklist an entire role by typing `-blacklist @role`, if that's how you roll.

### 4) Wait, what if I want only certain people to be able to use Marv?
Well, that's what we've got a whitelist for! To only let a certain person use Marv, type `-whitelist @user`. To whitelist a role, type `-whitelist @role`.
