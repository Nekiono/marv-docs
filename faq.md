# FAQ

### 1) Help! Marv drank a red bull and is playing music really quickly!
Don't worry! All you have to do is type `-fix it` and Marv will play music at normal speed again.

### 2) Marv keeps pausing and playing/stuttering.
First, try changing your server region. If that does not fix it, please contact someone in the support channel.

### 3) How do I stop certain people from using Marv?
Marv has a **blacklist** feature for this exact purpose. All you have to do is type `-blacklist @user` and they will be unable to use Marv in your server. You may also blacklist an entire role, if that's how you roll.
